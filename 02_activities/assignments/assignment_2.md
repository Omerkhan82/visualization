## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```

Good Data Visualization

Description and Classification

For my example of a good data visualization, I have selected a Tableau dashboard on global CO2 emissions from the Tableau Public Gallery. This visualization effectively presents CO2 emissions by country, using a combination of an interactive world map and a time-series line chart.

This visualization is classified as "good" because it follows key design principles:

Clarity: The color-coded map clearly distinguishes high-emission countries from low-emission ones using a gradient scale.

Data Integrity: The data is presented accurately without misleading visual elements or distortions.

Interactivity: Users can hover over countries to see specific values, which enhances engagement.

Comparability: The line chart helps track emissions over time, providing context and trends.

Accessibility: The visualization includes labels, a clear title, and a well-defined legend, making it easy to interpret.



Bad Data Visualization

Description and Classification

For my example of a bad data visualization, I have chosen a 3D pie chart on social media usage found on an infographic website. This chart attempts to show the percentage of users on different platforms but fails in multiple aspects.

This visualization is classified as "bad" due to the following reasons:

Misleading 3D Effects: The 3D perspective distorts proportions, making it difficult to compare slices accurately.

Overuse of Colors: Each platform is assigned a different color, but some shades are too similar, leading to confusion.

Lack of Labels and Context: The chart does not include the total number of users, timeframe, or data source, reducing credibility.

Overcrowding: Too many categories make it cluttered and hard to interpret at a glance.

Difficult Comparisons: Pie charts are generally poor at facilitating comparisons between categories, especially when multiple segments are similar in size.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?

Suggested Improvements (Good Data Visulization)

Despite its strengths, the visualization could be improved in the following ways:

Better Contrast: Some colors on the map are too similar, making it hard to distinguish mid-range values.

Annotations for Key Events: Adding annotations for major global policies or events impacting emissions could enhance storytelling.

Mobile Optimization: The dashboard could be optimized for smaller screens by simplifying the layout.

Suggested Improvements (Bad Data Visualization)

To enhance the clarity and effectiveness of this visualization, the following changes are recommended:

Use a Bar Chart Instead: A horizontal or vertical bar chart would better represent the differences in social media usage.

Avoid 3D Effects: Switching to a 2D design ensures that proportions are accurately depicted.

Include Annotations and Context: Adding a title, data source, and timeframe improves transparency.

Simplify the Categories: If there are too many segments, grouping smaller ones into an "Other" category can declutter the chart.





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
